# 🚀 PROJECT: Naveen ❤️ Karthika — Love to Marriage Cinematic Journey Website

Follow the B.L.A.S.T. (Blueprint → Link → Architect → Stylize → Trigger) protocol strictly.
Do NOT skip phases.
Do NOT generate code before Blueprint approval.

GOAL:
Build a cinematic, emotional storytelling website that presents the real-life love journey of Naveen and Karthika — from strangers on Instagram to marriage and parenthood.

This is NOT a game.
This is a romantic digital cinematic experience.

The website should feel like a short emotional movie with music, animations, and beautiful UI.

## 🟢 Protocol 0 — Initialization (MANDATORY)

Initialize project memory:

Create:
- task_plan.md

- progress.md
- gemini.md (Project Constitution)

gemini.md must define:
- journey data schema
- scene engine rules
- UI design standards
- emotional tone guidelines

- storytelling principles

Do not generate any frontend code until Blueprint approval.
